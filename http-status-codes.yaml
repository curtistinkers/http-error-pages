    400:
      reason: 'Bad Request'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or
        will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be
        a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message
        framing, or deceptive request routing).
    401:
      reason: Unauthorized
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 401 (Unauthorized) status code indicates that the request has not
        been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the
        target resource. The server generating a 401 response MUST send a
        WWW-Authenticate header field (Section 11.6.1) containing at least one
        challenge applicable to the target resource.
    402:
      reason: 'Payment Required'
      enabled: true
      description: The 402 (Payment Required) status code is reserved for future use.
    403:
      reason: Forbidden
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood
        the request but refuses to fulfill it. A server that wishes to make
        public why the request has been forbidden can describe that reason in
        the response content (if any).
    404:
      reason: 'Not Found'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did
        not find a current representation for the target resource or is not
        willing to disclose that one exists. A 404 status code does not
        indicate whether this lack of representation is temporary or permanent;
        the 410 (Gone) status code is preferred over 404 if the origin server
        knows, presumably through some configurable means, that the condition
        is likely to be permanent.
    405:
      reason: 'Method Not Allowed'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code indicates that the method
        received in the request-line is known by the origin server but not
        supported by the target resource. The origin server MUST generate an
        Allow header field in a 405 response containing a list of the target
        resource's currently supported methods.
    406:
      reason: 'Not Acceptable'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 406 (Not Acceptable) status code indicates that the target resource
        does not have a current representation that would be acceptable to the
        user agent, according to the proactive negotiation header fields
        received in the request (Section 12.1), and the server is unwilling to
        supply a default representation.
    407:
      reason: 'Proxy Authentication Required'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) status code is similar to
        401 (Unauthorized), but it indicates that the client needs to
        authenticate itself in order to use a proxy for this request. The proxy
        MUST send a Proxy-Authenticate header field (Section 11.7.1) containing
        a challenge applicable to that proxy for the request. The client MAY
        repeat the request with a new or replaced Proxy-Authorization header
        field (Section 11.7.2).
    408:
      reason: 'Request Timeout'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 408 (Request Timeout) status code indicates that the server did not
        receive a complete request message within the time that it was prepared
        to wait.
    409:
      reason: Conflict
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 409 (Conflict) status code indicates that the request could not be
        completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target
        resource. This code is used in situations where the user might be able
        to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The server SHOULD
        generate content that includes enough information for a user to
        recognize the source of the conflict.
    410:
      reason: Gone
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 410 (Gone) status code indicates that access to the target resource
        is no longer available at the origin server and that this condition is
        likely to be permanent. If the origin server does not know, or has no
        facility to determine, whether or not the condition is permanent, the
        status code 404 (Not Found) ought to be used instead.
    411:
      reason: 'Length Required'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 411 (Length Required) status code indicates that the server refuses
        to accept the request without a defined Content-Length (Section 8.6).
        The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid Content-Length
        header field containing the length of the request content.
    412:
      reason: 'Precondition Failed'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 412 (Precondition Failed) status code indicates that one or more
        conditions given in the request header fields evaluated to false when
        tested on the server (Section 13). This response status code allows the
        client to place preconditions on the current resource state (its
        current representations and metadata) and, thus, prevent the request
        method from being applied if the target resource is in an
        unexpected state.
    413:
      reason: 'Payload Too Large'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 413 (Content Too Large) status code indicates that the server is
        refusing to process a request because the request content is larger
        than the server is willing or able to process. The server MAY terminate
        the request, if the protocol version in use allows it; otherwise, the
        server MAY close the connection.
    414:
      reason: 'URI Too Long'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is
        refusing to service the request because the target URI is longer than
        the server is willing to interpret. This rare condition is only likely
        to occur when a client has improperly converted a POST request to a GET
        request with long query information, when the client has descended into
        an infinite loop of redirection (e.g., a redirected URI prefix that
        points to a suffix of itself) or when the server is under attack by a
        client attempting to exploit potential security holes.
    415:
      reason: 'Unsupported Media Type'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code indicates that the origin
        server is refusing to service the request because the content is in a
        format not supported by this method on the target resource. The format
        problem might be due to the request's indicated Content-Type or
        Content-Encoding, or as a result of inspecting the data directly.
    416:
      reason: 'Range Not Satisfiable'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 416 (Range Not Satisfiable) status code indicates that the set of
        ranges in the request's Range header field (Section 14.2) has been
        rejected either because none of the requested ranges are satisfiable or
        because the client has requested an excessive number of small or
        overlapping ranges (a potential denial of service attack).
    417:
      reason: 'Expectation Failed'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 417 (Expectation Failed) status code indicates that the expectation
        given in the request's Expect header field (Section 10.1.1) could not
        be met by at least one of the inbound servers.
    418:
      reason: "I'm a teapot"
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        [RFC2324] was an April 1 RFC that lampooned the various ways HTTP was
        abused; one such abuse was the definition of an application-specific
        418 status code, which has been deployed as a joke often enough for the
        code to be unusable for any future use.
    421:
      reason: 'Misdirected Request'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 421 (Misdirected Request) status code indicates that the request
        was directed at a server that is unable or unwilling to produce and
        uthoritative response for the target URI. An origin server (or gateway
        acting on behalf of the origin server) sends 421 to reject a target URI
        that does not match an origin for which the server has been configured
        (Section 4.3.1) or does not match the connection context over which the
        request was received (Section 7.4).
    422:
      reason: 'Unprocessable Content'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 422 (Unprocessable Content) status code indicates that the server
        understands the content type of the request content (hence a
        415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the
        syntax of the request content is correct, but it was unable to process
        the contained instructions. For example, this status code can be sent
        if an XML request content contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically
        correct), but semantically erroneous XML instructions.

        The 426 (Upgrade Required) status code indicates that the server
        refuses to perform the request using the current protocol but might be
        willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol. The
        server MUST send an Upgrade header field in a 426 response to indicate
        the required protocol(s) (Section 7.8).

      reason: 'Internal Server Error'

      description: >-
        The 500 (Internal Server Error) status code indicates that the server
        encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling
        the request.
    501:
      reason: 'Not Implemented'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 501 (Not Implemented) status code indicates that the server does
        not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. This is
        the appropriate response when the server does not recognize the request
        method and is not capable of supporting it for any resource.
    502:
      reason: 'Bad Gateway'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 502 (Bad Gateway) status code indicates that the server, while
        acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an
        inbound server it accessed while attempting to fulfill the request.
    503:
      reason: 'Service Unavailable'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 503 (Service Unavailable) status code indicates that the server is
        currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload or
        scheduled maintenance, which will likely be alleviated after some
        delay. The server MAY send a Retry-After header field (Section 10.2.3)
        to suggest an appropriate amount of time for the client to wait before
        retrying the request.
    504:
      reason: 'Gateway Timeout'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 504 (Gateway Timeout) status code indicates that the server, while

        upstream server it needed to access in order to complete the request.
    505:
      reason: 'HTTP Version Not Supported'
      enabled: true
      description: >-
        The 505 (HTTP Version Not Supported) status code indicates that the
        server does not support, or refuses to support, the major version of
        HTTP that was used in the request message. The server is indicating
        that it is unable or unwilling to complete the request using the same
        major version as the client, as described in Section 2.5, other than
        with this error message. The server SHOULD generate a representation
        for the 505 response that describes why that version is not supported
        and what other protocols are supported by that server.
